==================

**Work in Progress** for what shall eventually become http://androiddesign.tips

Keep this under your hat for now yeah?

Development
-----------

I'm a boring old Jekyll site, so the setup is the usual:

```
# Install dependencies
bundle install
# Run the Jekyll server, watching for any changes
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```
